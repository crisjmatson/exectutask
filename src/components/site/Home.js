					Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Let that brush dance around
					there and play. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. This painting
					comes right out of your heart. It takes dark in order to show light.
					That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want -
					and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Isn't that fantastic?
					You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. If these
					lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your
					painting and get your floor wet. Tree trunks grow however makes them
					happy. Just let these leaves jump off the brush How do you make a
					round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.
					Let's build some happy little clouds up here. If you didn't have baby
					clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. You don't have to be crazy to do
					this but it does help. It's amazing what you can do with a little love
					in your heart. Let your imagination be your guide.
